=================

Plugin to show if references in Zotero have PubPeer comments

Install by downloading the [latest XPI](https://github.com/PubPeerFoundation/pubpeer_zotero_plugin/releases/latest) – if you use Firefox, make sure to right-click and save the XPI file, not just clicking it – and then in Zotero:

* In the main menu go to Tools > Add-ons
* Select ‘Extensions’
* Click on the gear in the top-right corner and choose ‘Install Add-on From File…’
* Choose the .xpi that you’ve just downloaded, click ‘Install’
* Restart Zotero

After the initial installation, the plugin will auto-update to newer releases, so you should need to perform the process described here only once.

To test, use DOI 10.1080/15548627.2015.1100356
